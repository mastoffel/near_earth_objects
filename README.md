# Explore Close Approaches of Near-Earth Objects

# Project
This is a project from [Udacity's](https://www.udacity.com/) 'Intermediate Python' course. 

# Data
NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) provides data about NEOs and close approaches, which can be found [here](https://ssd-api.jpl.nasa.gov/doc/cad.html).

# Usage

### Overview
`python3 main.py --help` 

### `inspect`

The `inspect` subcommand inspects a single NEO, printing its details in a human-readable format. The NEO is specified with exactly one of the `--pdes` option (the primary designation) and the `--name` option (the IAU name). The `--verbose` flag additionally prints out, in a human-readable form, all known close approaches to Earth made by this NEO. See `python3 main.py inspect --help`:

Example: 

```
# Inspect the NEO with a primary designation of 433 (that's Eros!)
$ python3 main.py inspect --pdes 433
NEO 433 (Eros) has a diameter of 16.840 km and is not potentially hazardous.
```

### `query`

The `query` subcommand generates a collection of close approaches that match a set of specified filters, and either displays a limited set of those results to standard output or writes the structured results to a file. See `python3 main.py query --help`

Example:

```
# Show (the first) three close approaches in 2021 of potentially hazardous NEOs at least 100m in diameter that pass within 0.1au of Earth at a relative velocity of at least 15 kilometers per second.
$ python3 main.py query --start-date 2021-01-01 --max-distance 0.1 --min-velocity 15 --min-diameter 0.1 --hazardous --limit 3
On 2021-01-21 22:56, '363024' approaches Earth at a distance of 0.07 au and a velocity of 15.31 km/s.
On 2021-02-01 22:26, '2016 CL136' approaches Earth at a distance of 0.04 au and a velocity of 18.06 km/s.
On 2021-08-21 15:10, '2016 AJ193' approaches Earth at a distance of 0.02 au and a velocity of 26.17 km/s.

# Save, to a CSV file,  all close approaches.
$ python3 main.py query --outfile results.csv

# Save, to a JSON file, all close approaches in the 2020s of NEOs at least 1km in diameter that pass between 0.01 au and 0.1 au away from Earth.
$ python3 main.py query --start-date 2020-01-01 --end-date 2029-12-31 --min-diameter 1 --min-distance 0.01 --max-distance 0.1 --outfile results.json
```

### `interactive`

There's a third useful subcommand named `interactive`. This subcommand first loads the database and then starts a command loop so that you can repeatedly run `inspect` and `query` subcommands on the database without having to wait to reload the data each time. See `python3 main.py interactive --help`

Example:

```
$ python3 main.py interactive
Explore close approaches of near-Earth objects. Type `help` or `?` to list commands and `exit` to exit.

(neo) inspect --pdes 433
NEO 433 (Eros) has a diameter of 16.840 km and is not potentially hazardous.
(neo) help i
Shorthand for `inspect`.
(neo) i --name Halley
NEO 1P (Halley) has a diameter of 11.000 km and is not potentially hazardous.
(neo) query --date 2020-12-31 --limit 2
On 2020-12-31 05:48, '2010 PQ10' approaches Earth at a distance of 0.45 au and a velocity of 21.69 km/s.
On 2020-12-31 16:00, '2015 YA' approaches Earth at a distance of 0.17 au and a velocity of 5.65 km/s.
(neo) q --date 2021-3-14 --min-velocity 10
On 2021-03-14 06:17, '2019 DS1' approaches Earth at a distance of 0.39 au and a velocity of 20.17 km/s.
On 2021-03-14 20:19, '483656' approaches Earth at a distance of 0.06 au and a velocity of 12.09 km/s.
